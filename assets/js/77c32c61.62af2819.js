Instead of relying on centralized servers, IPFS identifies files by their unique cryptographic hash, ensuring that content is verifiable, tamper-proof, and accessible from multiple nodes across the network. IPFS services\u2014such as gateways, pinning providers, and APIs\u2014make it easier for developers and organizations to integrate decentralized storage into their applications without having to run and maintain their own nodes. These services help bridge the gap between raw IPFS infrastructure and practical use cases like hosting websites, managing NFTs, archiving data, and powering Web3 applications.","slug":"/category/ipfs-services","permalink":"/wiki/docs/category/ipfs-services","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"TON Blockchain Indexer","permalink":"/wiki/docs/Indexer/ton-indexer"},"next":{"title":"Introduction","permalink":"/wiki/docs/IPFS/intro"}}}}')}}]);
