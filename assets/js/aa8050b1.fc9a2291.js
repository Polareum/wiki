Since private keys are the foundation of ownership and identity on a blockchain, their loss or compromise can mean irreversible loss of funds or control. Blockchain-focused KMS solutions automate key lifecycle tasks such as generation, rotation, signing, and recovery, while ensuring that raw keys are never exposed to applications or users. They often integrate with hardware security modules (HSMs), multi-party computation (MPC), and policy-based access controls to provide enterprise-grade protection. By abstracting the complexities of cryptography, blockchain KMS services make it easier to scale secure operations in Web3, DeFi, and enterprise blockchain environments.","slug":"/category/kms","permalink":"/wiki/docs/category/kms","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Introduction","permalink":"/wiki/docs/IPFS/intro"},"next":{"title":"Introduction","permalink":"/wiki/docs/KMS/intro"}}}}')}}]);
