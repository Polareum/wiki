Instead of constantly polling a blockchain node for updates\u2014which can be inefficient and resource-heavy\u2014webhooks push relevant data directly to an application\u2019s backend the moment it happens. This makes it much easier to build responsive dApps, wallets, payment systems, and monitoring tools that react instantly to on-chain activity.
