Since raw blockchain data is stored in a decentralized, append-only ledger, querying it directly can be slow and resource-intensive. Indexers solve this by continuously scanning blocks, transactions, and events, then structuring that information in optimized databases that support fast lookups and complex queries. This allows developers to build user-friendly interfaces, analytics dashboards, wallets, and decentralized applications (dApps) without manually parsing low-level blockchain data. In short, blockchain indexers act as the bridge between complex blockchain records and practical, real-world applications.","slug":"/category/indexer-services","permalink":"/wiki/docs/category/indexer-services","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/wiki/docs/intro"},"next":{"title":"Introduction","permalink":"/wiki/docs/Indexer/intro"}}}}')}}]);
